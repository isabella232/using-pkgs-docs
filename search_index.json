Installation","keywords":"","body":"Local Installation\nThere are two ways to install npm packages: locally or globally. You choose which kind of\ninstallation to use based on how you want to use the package.\nIf you want to depend on the package from your own module using something like Node.js'\nrequire, then you want to install locally, which is npm install's default behavior.\nOn the other hand, if you want to use it as a command line tool, something like the grunt CLI,\nthen you want to install it globally.\nTo learn more about the install command's behavior, check out the CLI doc page.\nInstalling\nA package can be downloaded with the command\n> npm install \nThis will create the node_modules directory in your current directory(if one doesn't exist yet),\nand will download the package to that directory.\nTest:\nTo confirm that npm install worked correctly, check to see that a node_modules\ndirectory exists and that it contains a directory for the package(s) you installed.\nYou can do this by run ls node_modules on Unix systems, e.g. \"OSX\", \"Debian\", or dir node_modules\non Windows.\nExample:\nInstall a package called lodash.

Otherwise it will fill in default\nvalues: \n> npm init --yes\nWrote to /home/ag_dubs/my_package/package.json:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"my_package\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"ag_dubs\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package.git\"\n  },\n  \"bugs\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package/issues\"\n  },\n  \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package\"\n}\n\nname: defaults to author name unless in a git directory, in which case it\n  will be the name of the repository\nversion: always 1.0.0\nmain: always index.js\nscripts: by default creates a empty test script\nkeywords: empty\nauthor: whatever you provided the CLI\nlicense: ISC\nrepository: will pull in info from the current directory, if present\nbugs: will pull in info from the current directory, if present\nhomepage: will pull in info from the current directory, if present\n\nYou can also set several config options for the init command. Some useful ones:\n> npm set init.author.email \"wombat@npmjs.com\"\n> npm set init.author.name \"ag_dubs\"\n> npm set init.license \"MIT\"\nNOTE:\nIf there is no description field in the package.json, npm uses the first line of the README.md or README instead. The description helps people find your package on npm search, so it's definitely useful to make a custom description in the package.json to make your package more discoverable.\nSpecifying Packages\nTo specify the packages your project depends on, you need to \nlist the packages you'd like to use in your package.json file. There are\n2 types of packages you can list:\n\n\"dependencies\": these packages are required by your application in production\n\"devDependencies\": these packages are only needed for development and testing\n\nManually editing your package.json\nYou can manually edit your package.json. You'll need to create an attribute\nin the package object called dependencies that points to an object. This object\nwill hold attributes named after the packages you'd like to use, that point to a \nsemver expression that specifies what versions of that project are \ncompatible with your project.\nIf you have dependencies you only need to use during local development, you will\nfollow the same instructions as above but in an attribute called devDependencies.\nFor example: The project below uses any version of the package my_dep that matches\nmajor version 1 in production, and requires any version of the package my_test_framework\nthat matches major version 3, but only for development:\n{\n  \"name\": \"my_package\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"my_dep\": \"^1.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\" : {\n    \"my_test_framework\": \"^3.1.0\"\n  }\n}\nThe --save and --save-dev install flags\nThe easier (and more awesome) way to add dependencies to your package.json is to do\nso from the command line, flagging the npm install command with either --save or\n--save-dev, depending on how you'd like to use that dependency.\nTo add an entry to your package.json's dependencies:\nnpm install  --save\nTo add an entry to your package.json's devDependencies:\nnpm install  --save-dev\nManaging dependency versions\nnpm uses Semantic Versioning, or, as we often refer to it, SemVer, to manage versions\nand ranges of versions of packages.\nIf you have a package.json file in your directory and you run\nnpm install, then npm will look at the dependencies that are listed in\nthat file and download the latest versions satisfying semver rules\nfor all of those.\nTo learn more about semantic versioning, check out our Getting Started \"Semver\" page.\n"},"package-json/the-package-json-file.html":{"url":"package-json/the-package-json-file.html","title":"The package.json File","keywords":"","body":"The package.json File\nThis document is all you need to know about what's required in your package.json\nfile.  It must be actual JSON, not just a JavaScript object literal.\nA lot of the behavior described in this document is affected by the config\nsettings described in npm-config(7).\nname\nThe most important things in your package.json are the name and version fields.\nThose are actually required, and your package won't install without\nthem.  The name and version together form an identifier that is assumed\nto be completely unique.  Changes to the package should come along with\nchanges to the version.\nThe name is what your thing is called.\nSome rules:\n\nThe name must be less than or equal to 214 characters. This includes the scope for\nscoped packages.\nThe name can't start with a dot or an underscore.\nNew packages must not have uppercase letters in the name.\nThe name ends up being part of a URL, an argument on the command line, and a\nfolder name. Therefore, the name can't contain any non-URL-safe characters.\n\nSome tips:\n\nDon't use the same name as a core Node module.\nDon't put \"js\" or \"node\" in the name.  It's assumed that it's js, since you're\nwriting a package.json file, and you can specify the engine using the \"engines\"\nfield.  (See below.)\nThe name will probably be passed as an argument to require(), so it should\nbe something short, but also reasonably descriptive.\nYou may want to check the npm registry to see if there's something by that name\nalready, before you get too attached to it. https://www.npmjs.com/\n\nA name can be optionally prefixed by a scope, e.g. @myorg/mypackage.

(npm install semver to use it yourself.)\nMore on version numbers and ranges at semver(7).\ndescription\nPut a description in it.  It's a string.  This helps people discover your\npackage, as it's listed in npm search.\nkeywords\nPut keywords in it.  It's an array of strings.  This helps people\ndiscover your package as it's listed in npm search.\nhomepage\nThe url to the project homepage.\nbugs\nThe url to your project's issue tracker and / or the email address to which\nissues should be reported. These are helpful for people who encounter issues\nwith your package.\nIt should look like this:\n{ \"url\" : \"https://github.com/owner/project/issues\"\n, \"email\" : \"project@hostname.com\"\n}\nYou can specify either one or both values. If you want to provide only a url,\nyou can specify the value for \"bugs\" as a simple string instead of an object.\nIf a url is provided, it will be used by the npm bugs command.\nlicense\nYou should specify a license for your package so that people know how they are\npermitted to use it, and any restrictions you're placing on it.\nIf you're using a common license such as BSD-2-Clause or MIT, add a\ncurrent SPDX license identifier for the license you're using, like this:\n{ \"license\" : \"BSD-3-Clause\" }\nYou can check the full list of SPDX license IDs.\nIdeally you should pick one that is\nOSI approved.\nIf your package is licensed under multiple common licenses, use an SPDX license\nexpression syntax version 2.0 string, like this:\n{ \"license\" : \"(ISC OR GPL-3.0)\" }\nIf you are using a license that hasn't been assigned an SPDX identifier, or if\nyou are using a custom license, use a string value like this one:\n{ \"license\" : \"SEE LICENSE IN \" }\nThen include a file named  at the top level of the package.\nSome old packages used license objects or a \"licenses\" property containing an\narray of license objects:\n// Not valid metadata\n{ \"license\" :\n  { \"type\" : \"ISC\"\n  , \"url\" : \"http://opensource.org/licenses/ISC\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Not valid metadata\n{ \"licenses\" :\n  [\n    { \"type\": \"MIT\"\n    , \"url\": \"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\"\n    }\n  , { \"type\": \"Apache-2.0\"\n    , \"url\": \"http://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThose styles are now deprecated. Instead, use SPDX expressions, like this:\n{ \"license\": \"ISC\" }\n\n{ \"license\": \"(MIT OR Apache-2.0)\" }\nFinally, if you do not wish to grant others the right to use a private or\nunpublished package under any terms:\n{ \"license\": \"UNLICENSED\"}\nConsider also setting \"private\": true to prevent accidental publication.\npeople fields: author, contributors\nThe \"author\" is one person.  \"contributors\" is an array of people.  A \"person\"\nis an object with a \"name\" field and optionally \"url\" and \"email\", like this:\n{ \"name\" : \"Barney Rubble\"\n, \"email\" : \"b@rubble.com\"\n, \"url\" : \"http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/\"\n}\nOr you can shorten that all into a single string, and npm will parse it for you:\n\"Barney Rubble  (http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/)\"\nBoth email and url are optional either way.\nnpm also sets a top-level \"maintainers\" field with your npm user info.\nfiles\nThe \"files\" field is an array of files to include in your project.  If\nyou name a folder in the array, then it will also include the files\ninside that folder. (Unless they would be ignored by another rule.)\nYou can also provide a \".npmignore\" file in the root of your package or\nin subdirectories, which will keep files from being included, even\nif they would be picked up by the files array.  The .npmignore file\nworks just like a .gitignore.\nCertain files are always included, regardless of settings:\n\npackage.json\nREADME\nCHANGES / CHANGELOG / HISTORY\nLICENSE / LICENCE\nThe file in the \"main\" field\n\nREADME, CHANGES & LICENSE can have any case and extension.\nConversely, some files are always ignored:\n\n.git\nCVS\n.svn\n.hg\n.lock-wscript\n.wafpickle-N\n.*.swp\n.DS_Store\n._*\nnpm-debug.log\n.npmrc\nnode_modules\n\nmain\nThe main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your program.\nThat is, if your package is named foo, and a user installs it, and then does\nrequire(\"foo\"), then your main module's exports object will be returned.\nThis should be a module ID relative to the root of your package folder.\nFor most modules, it makes the most sense to have a main script and often not\nmuch else.\nbin\nA lot of packages have one or more executable files that they'd like to\ninstall into the PATH. npm makes this pretty easy (in fact, it uses this\nfeature to install the \"npm\" executable.)\nTo use this, supply a bin field in your package.json which is a map of\ncommand name to local file name. On install, npm will symlink that file into\nprefix/bin for global installs, or ./node_modules/.bin/ for local\ninstalls.\nFor example, myapp could have this:\n{ \"bin\" : { \"myapp\" : \"./cli.js\" } }\nSo, when you install myapp, it'll create a symlink from the cli.js script to\n/usr/local/bin/myapp.\nIf you have a single executable, and its name should be the name\nof the package, then you can just supply it as a string.  For example:\n{ \"name\": \"my-program\"\n, \"version\": \"1.2.5\"\n, \"bin\": \"./path/to/program\" }\nwould be the same as this:\n{ \"name\": \"my-program\"\n, \"version\": \"1.2.5\"\n, \"bin\" : { \"my-program\" : \"./path/to/program\" } }\nman\nSpecify either a single file or an array of filenames to put in place for the\nman program to find.\nIf only a single file is provided, then it's installed such that it is the\nresult from man , regardless of its actual filename.  For example:\n{ \"name\" : \"foo\"\n, \"version\" : \"1.2.3\"\n, \"description\" : \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\"\n, \"main\" : \"foo.js\"\n, \"man\" : \"./man/doc.1\"\n}\nwould link the ./man/doc.1 file in such that it is the target for man foo\nIf the filename doesn't start with the package name, then it's prefixed.\nSo, this:\n{ \"name\" : \"foo\"\n, \"version\" : \"1.2.3\"\n, \"description\" : \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\"\n, \"main\" : \"foo.js\"\n, \"man\" : [ \"./man/foo.1\", \"./man/bar.1\" ]\n}\nwill create files to do man foo and man foo-bar.\nMan files must end with a number, and optionally a .gz suffix if they are\ncompressed.  The number dictates which man section the file is installed into.\n{ \"name\" : \"foo\"\n, \"version\" : \"1.2.3\"\n, \"description\" : \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\"\n, \"main\" : \"foo.js\"\n, \"man\" : [ \"./man/foo.1\", \"./man/foo.2\" ]\n}\nwill create entries for man foo and man 2 foo\ndirectories\nThe CommonJS Packages spec details a\nfew ways that you can indicate the structure of your package using a directories\nobject. If you look at npm's package.json,\nyou'll see that it has directories for doc, lib, and man.\nIn the future, this information may be used in other creative ways.\ndirectories.lib\nTell people where the bulk of your library is.  Nothing special is done\nwith the lib folder in any way, but it's useful meta info.\ndirectories.bin\nIf you specify a bin directory in directories.bin, all the files in\nthat folder will be added.\nBecause of the way the bin directive works, specifying both a\nbin path and setting directories.bin is an error. If you want to\nspecify individual files, use bin, and for all the files in an\nexisting bin directory, use directories.bin.\ndirectories.man\nA folder that is full of man pages.  Sugar to generate a \"man\" array by\nwalking the folder.\ndirectories.doc\nPut markdown files in here.  Eventually, these will be displayed nicely,\nmaybe, someday.\ndirectories.example\nPut example scripts in here.  Someday, it might be exposed in some clever way.\ndirectories.test\nPut your tests in here. It is currently not exposed, but it might be in the\nfuture.\nrepository\nSpecify the place where your code lives. This is helpful for people who\nwant to contribute.  If the git repo is on GitHub, then the npm docs\ncommand will be able to find you.\nDo it like this:\n\"repository\" :\n  { \"type\" : \"git\"\n  , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/npm/npm.git\"\n  }\n\n\"repository\" :\n  { \"type\" : \"svn\"\n  , \"url\" : \"https://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/\"\n  }\nThe URL should be a publicly available (perhaps read-only) url that can be handed\ndirectly to a VCS program without any modification.  It should not be a url to an\nhtml project page that you put in your browser.  It's for computers.\nFor GitHub, GitHub gist, Bitbucket, or GitLab repositories you can use the same\nshortcut syntax you use for npm install:\n\"repository\": \"npm/npm\"\n\n\"repository\": \"gist:11081aaa281\"\n\n\"repository\": \"bitbucket:example/repo\"\n\n\"repository\": \"gitlab:another/repo\"\nscripts\nThe \"scripts\" property is a dictionary containing script commands that are run\nat various times in the lifecycle of your package.  The key is the lifecycle\nevent, and the value is the command to run at that point.\nSee npm-scripts(7) to find out more about writing package scripts.\nconfig\nA \"config\" object can be used to set configuration parameters used in package\nscripts that persist across upgrades.  For instance, if a package had the\nfollowing:\n{ \"name\" : \"foo\"\n, \"config\" : { \"port\" : \"8080\" } }\nand then had a \"start\" command that then referenced the\nnpm_package_config_port environment variable, then the user could\noverride that by doing npm config set foo:port 8001.\nSee npm-config(7) and npm-scripts(7) for more on package\nconfigs.\nengines\nYou can specify the version of node that your stuff works on:\n{ \"engines\" : { \"node\" : \">=0.10.3 And, like with dependencies, if you don't specify the version (or if you\nspecify \"*\" as the version), then any version of node will do.\nIf you specify an \"engines\" field, then npm will require that \"node\" be\nsomewhere on that list. If \"engines\" is omitted, then npm will just assume\nthat it works on node.\nYou can also use the \"engines\" field to specify which versions of npm\nare capable of properly installing your program.  For example:\n{ \"engines\" : { \"npm\" : \"~1.0.20\" } }\nUnless the user has set the engine-strict config flag, this\nfield is advisory only will produce warnings when your package is installed as a dependency.\nengineStrict\nThis feature was deprecated with npm 3.0.0\nPrior to npm 3.0.0, this feature was used to treat this package as if the\nuser had set engine-strict.\nos\nYou can specify which operating systems your\nmodule will run on:\n\"os\" : [ \"darwin\", \"linux\" ]\nYou can also blacklist instead of whitelist operating systems,\njust prepend the blacklisted os with a '!':\n\"os\" : [ \"!win32\" ]\nThe host operating system is determined by process.platform\nIt is allowed to both blacklist, and whitelist, although there isn't any\ngood reason to do this.\ncpu\nIf your code only runs on certain cpu architectures,\nyou can specify which ones.\n\"cpu\" : [ \"x64\", \"ia32\" ]\nLike the os option, you can also blacklist architectures:\n\"cpu\" : [ \"!arm\", \"!mips\" ]\nThe host architecture is determined by process.arch\npreferGlobal\nIf your package is primarily a command-line application that should be\ninstalled globally, then set this value to true to provide a warning\nif it is installed locally.\nIt doesn't actually prevent users from installing it locally, but it\ndoes help prevent some confusion if it doesn't work as expected.\nprivate\nIf you set \"private\": true in your package.json, then npm will refuse\nto publish it.\nThis is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories.  If\nyou would like to ensure that a given package is only ever published to a\nspecific registry (for example, an internal registry), then use the\npublishConfig dictionary described below to override the registry config\nparam at publish-time.\npublishConfig\nThis is a set of config values that will be used at publish-time. It's\nespecially handy if you want to set the tag, registry or access, so that\nyou can ensure that a given package is not tagged with \"latest\", published\nto the global public registry or that a scoped module is private by default.\nAny config values can be overridden, but of course only \"tag\", \"registry\" and\n\"access\" probably matter for the purposes of publishing.\nSee npm-config(7) to see the list of config options that can be\noverridden.\nDEFAULT VALUES\nnpm will default some values based on package contents.\n\n\"scripts\": {\"start\": \"node server.js\"}\nIf there is a server.js file in the root of your package, then npm\nwill default the start command to node server.js.\n\n\"scripts\":{\"preinstall\": \"node-gyp rebuild\"}\nIf there is a binding.gyp file in the root of your package, npm will\ndefault the preinstall command to compile using node-gyp.\n\n\"contributors\": [...]\nIf there is an AUTHORS file in the root of your package, npm will\ntreat each line as a Name  (url) format, where email and url\nare optional.

The package.json file is still\nrequired if you want to use npm install.\nBy default, npm install recursively installs the target's\ndependencies (as specified in package.json), choosing the latest\navailable version that satisfies the dependency's semver pattern. In\nsome situations, particularly when shipping software where each change\nis tightly managed, it's desirable to fully specify each version of\neach dependency recursively so that subsequent builds and deploys do\nnot inadvertently pick up newer versions of a dependency that satisfy\nthe semver pattern. Specifying specific semver patterns in each\ndependency's package.json would facilitate this, but that's not always\npossible or desirable, as when another author owns the npm package.\nIt's also possible to check dependencies directly into source control,\nbut that may be undesirable for other reasons.\nAs an example, consider package A:\n{\n  \"name\": \"A\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"B\": \"package B:\n{\n  \"name\": \"B\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"C\": \"and package C:\n{\n  \"name\": \"C\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\"\n}\nIf these are the only versions of A, B, and C available in the\nregistry, then a normal npm install A will install:\nA@0.1.0\n`-- B@0.0.1\n    `-- C@0.0.1\nHowever, if B@0.0.2 is published, then a fresh npm install A will\ninstall:\nA@0.1.0\n`-- B@0.0.2\n    `-- C@0.0.1\nassuming the new version did not modify B's dependencies. Of course,\nthe new version of B could include a new version of C and any number\nof new dependencies. If such changes are undesirable, the author of A\ncould specify a dependency on B@0.0.1. However, if A's author and B's\nauthor are not the same person, there's no way for A's author to say\nthat he or she does not want to pull in newly published versions of C\nwhen B hasn't changed at all.\nIn this case, A's author can run\nnpm shrinkwrap\nThis generates npm-shrinkwrap.json, which will look something like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"A\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"B\": {\n      \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n      \"from\": \"B@^0.0.1\",\n      \"resolved\": \"https://registry.npmjs.org/B/-/B-0.0.1.tgz\",\n      \"dependencies\": {\n        \"C\": {\n          \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n          \"from\": \"org/C#v0.0.1\",\n          \"resolved\": \"git://github.com/org/C.git#5c380ae319fc4efe9e7f2d9c78b0faa588fd99b4\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe shrinkwrap command has locked down the dependencies based on what's\ncurrently installed in node_modules.  The installation behavior is changed to:\n\nThe module tree described by the shrinkwrap is reproduced. This means\nreproducing the structure described in the file, using the specific files\nreferenced in \"resolved\" if available, falling back to normal package\nresolution using \"version\" if one isn't.\n\nThe tree is walked and any missing dependencies are installed in the usual fashion.\n\n\nUsing shrinkwrapped packages\nUsing a shrinkwrapped package is no different than using any other\npackage: you can npm install it by hand, or add a dependency to your\npackage.json file and npm install it.\nBuilding shrinkwrapped packages\nTo shrinkwrap an existing package:\n\nRun npm install in the package root to install the current\nversions of all dependencies.\nValidate that the package works as expected with these versions.\nRun npm shrinkwrap, add npm-shrinkwrap.json to git, and publish\nyour package.\n\nTo add or update a dependency in a shrinkwrapped package:\n\nRun npm install in the package root to install the current\nversions of all dependencies.\nAdd or update dependencies. npm install --save each new or updated\npackage individually to update the package.json and the shrinkwrap.\nNote that they must be explicitly named in order to be installed: running\nnpm install with no arguments will merely reproduce the existing\nshrinkwrap.\nValidate that the package works as expected with the new\ndependencies.\nCommit the new npm-shrinkwrap.json, and publish your package.\n\nYou can use npm-outdated(1) to view dependencies with newer versions\navailable.\nOther Notes\nA shrinkwrap file must be consistent with the package's package.json\nfile. npm shrinkwrap will fail if required dependencies are not\nalready installed, since that would result in a shrinkwrap that\nwouldn't actually work. Similarly, the command will fail if there are\nextraneous packages (not referenced by package.json), since that would\nindicate that package.json is not correct.\nSince npm shrinkwrap is intended to lock down your dependencies for\nproduction use, devDependencies will not be included unless you\nexplicitly set the --dev flag when you run npm shrinkwrap.  If\ninstalled devDependencies are excluded, then npm will print a\nwarning.  If you want them to be installed with your module by\ndefault, please consider adding them to dependencies instead.\nIf shrinkwrapped package A depends on shrinkwrapped package B, B's\nshrinkwrap will not be used as part of the installation of A. However,\nbecause A's shrinkwrap is constructed from a valid installation of B\nand recursively specifies all dependencies, the contents of B's\nshrinkwrap will implicitly be included in A's shrinkwrap.\nCaveats\nIf you wish to lock down the specific bytes included in a package, for\nexample to have 100% confidence in being able to reproduce a\ndeployment or build, then you ought to check your dependencies into\nsource control, or pursue some other mechanism that can verify\ncontents rather than versions.\n"}}}
